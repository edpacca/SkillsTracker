# Skills Tracker Application

## Overview
The Skills Tracker is an application designed to help users categorise and track skills within structured topics. Each topic is divided into "Levels" which have a pre-requisite set of skills a user much _achieve_ before they can classify themselves as being proficient in a topic to a given level.

The application allows indiviual users to track their own skills, and (possibly _might keep it private_) view other user's progression within the same organisation. The administrator will be able to view, rank and asses all users based on skill sets.
